# AdmiralBulldog Sounds

Welcome! This is a desktop app that plays various [AdmiralBulldog](https://www.twitch.tv/admiralbulldog) sound bites when certain things happen in your Dota 2 matches. It is highly customisable, allowing you to choose which sound bites should play when.

## Features

- **Play sounds**: plays your chosen sounds when different things happen in your game. For example, it can play "
  ROOONS!" just before the bounty runes spawn, or "EEL" when you get healed.
- **Discord bot**: plays your choice of sounds through a Discord voice channel instead of only on your computer. It also
  has a customisable sound board which can manually play sounds on Discord to troll your friends.
- **Dota 2 mods**: replaces various in-game sounds, icons and text, similar to Bulldog's game as seen on his streams.

To download, or for more information, please check
