# AdmiralBulldog Sounds

This is an app that plays various [AdmiralBulldog](https://www.twitch.tv/admiralbulldog) sound bites for things that happen in your Dota 2 matches.

## Features
- **Play sounds**: plays various sounds when different things happen in your game. For example, it can play "ROOONS!" just before the bounty runes spawn, or "EEL" when you get healed.
- **Discord bot**: plays your choice of sounds through your Discord voice channel.
- **Dota 2 mod**: replaces some in-game sounds, icons and text, similar to Bulldog's game.
